We just recently deepened the savings from roughly 7% to 14% compared to the $500 deductible.\nhave you tried the EFT discount? It was just recently increased from 2% to 5%\nAre they using the paperless discount? An extra 2% savings?\nare they using Signal? A 5% upfront discount with an opportunity to qualify for up to 15% on renewal with good driving habits.\nFinally (last resort) you might try quoting the daughter in Bristol West (and be sure to use an effective date that gets the Advance quote discount).
